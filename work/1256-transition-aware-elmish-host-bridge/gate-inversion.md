# Production performance gate inversion

- Date: 2026-08-22
- Fixture: `tests/Elmish.Tests/TransitionHostBrowser/measure.mjs`
- Workload: `workspace-transition-production`
- Workload SHA-256: `a49fc53e890dc93961e68d821c6b680a7f10f1f8d1aadd2cc96787cdbdd73acb`

The load-bearing maximum renderer-task comparison was temporarily changed from `maximum <= 16` to
`maximum <= 0`. No workload, scale, p95, p99, dropped-frame, browser, or compositor condition changed.

Command:

```text
npm run measure -- --out /tmp/fsgg-1256-gate-inversion.json
```

Observed exit: `1` (expected red).

```json
{"result":"fail","maximum":4.807,"p95":2.685,"p99":3.172,"droppedFrames":0,"samples":800}
```

The comparison was then restored exactly to `maximum <= 16`.

Command:

```text
npm run measure -- --out /tmp/fsgg-1256-gate-restored.json
```

Observed exit: `0` (expected green).

```json
{"result":"pass","maximum":3.715,"p95":2.737,"p99":3.352,"droppedFrames":0,"samples":874}
```

The committed fixture retains `max <= 16`, `p95 <= 16`, `p99 <= 32`, `droppedFrames = 0`, and a
positive live-compositor trace requirement. The mutation is not present in source.

## Frame-evidence fail-closed inversion

`npm run test:trace-inversion` executes the same `summarizeTrace` function used by the production measurement. A measured-run trace with an `AnimationFrame` event whose duration is missing, and a second trace whose duration is corrupt, both throw `zero usable AnimationFrame duration samples`; a valid 26 ms duration produces one sample and one dropped frame. The restored production measurement then retained positive usable frame samples in every one of 20 measured runs, with drop count zero. No max, p95, p99, or dropped-frame threshold changed.
